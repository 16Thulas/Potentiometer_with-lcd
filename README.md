# Potentiometer_with-lcd
This project holds the concept ,by triggering the potentiometer which connected to pic16f877a microcontroller ,then with the connection of voltmeter with the potentiometer , the values are get noticed by LCD display in real time ,this had been implemented with the two channels connected with pic16f877a ,for to get real time data
With actication of ADCON register and ADRESH registers to carry out the two channels simultaneously with limited amount of delay
Moreover, it prints the 4-digit number with letters displayed for both channels 1 and 2 connected with microcontroller
